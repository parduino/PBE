This is the Performance Based Engineering (PBE) Application.
</h1> 
<p> 
The PBE Application (PBE App) is an open-source software 
(https://github.com/NHERI-SimCenterPBE) that provides researchers a tool to 
assess the performance of a building in an earthquake scenario. The application 
focuses on quantifying building performance through decision variables. Given 
that the properties of the buildings and the earthquake events are not known 
exactly, and that the simulation software and the user make simplifying 
assumptions in the numerical modeling of the structure, the estimate response of
the structure already exhibits significant variability. Such response can be 
estimated using our EE-UQ Application 
(<a href="https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/
research-tools/ee-uq-application/">https://simcenter.designsafe-ci.org/
research-tools/ee-uq-application/</a>). The PBE App builds on the EE-UQ App and 
uses its response estimates to assess the damage to building components and the
consequences of such damage.
<p> 
The user can characterize the simulation model, and the damage and loss model of
the structure, and the seismic hazard model in the PBE App. All models are 
interconnected by an uncertainty quantification framework that allows the user 
to define a flexible stochastic model for the problem. Given the stochastic 
model, the application first performs nonlinear response history simulations to
get the Engineering Demand Parameters (EDPs) that describe structural response
. Then those EDPs are used to assess the Damage Measures (DM) and Decision 
Variables (DV) that characterize structural performance. 
<p> 
Depending on the type of structural system, the fidelity of the numerical model 
and the number of EDP samples required, the response history simulations can be 
computationally prohibitively expensive. To overcome this impediment, the user 
has the option to perform the response simulations on the Stampede2 
supercomputer. Stampede2 is located at the Texas Advanced Computing Center and 
made available to the user through NHERI DesignSafe-CI, the cyberinfrastructure 
provider for the distributed NSF funded Natural Hazards in Engineering Research 
Infrastructure (NHERI) facility.
<p> 
The computations are performed in a workflow application. That is, the numerical
simulations are actually performed by a sequence of different applications. The
PBE backend software runs these various applications for the user, taking the 
outputs from some programs and providing them as inputs to others. The design 
of the PBE App is such that researchers are able to modify the backend 
application to utilize their own application in the workflow computations. 
This will ensure researchers are not limited to using the default applications
we provide and will be enthused to provide their own applications for others 
to use. 
<p>
This is Version 2.1.0 of the tool and as such is limited in scope. Researchers are
encouraged to comment on what additional features and applications they would 
like to see in the PBE App. If you want a feature, chances are many of your 
colleagues would also benefit from it.
